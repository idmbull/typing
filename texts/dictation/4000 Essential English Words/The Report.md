3.690000	9.210000		Lee sat **among**^[If you are among certain things, they are all around you.] the books at the **library**^[A library is a place where you go to read books.] and thought about his group project.

10.400000	12.450000		They had to **turn it in**^[turn in	nộp (bài tập, tài liệu…)] **soon**^[in a short time from now],
12.610000	15.440000		but he hadn't even started his part!
15.730000	18.340000		Jack and Claire were in his group.
18.530000	20.090000		They had worked hard.
20.380000	22.490000		They were also very smart,
22.590000	25.580000		and Lee didn't want them to get a bad **grade**^[A grade is a score or mark given to someone's work.].

26.660000	28.510000		Jack did the **report**^[A report is something someone writes for school or work.].
28.710000	31.460000		He wrote a lot of very good sentences
31.490000	34.330000		and **described**^[To describe is to say or write what someone or something is like.] things clearly and carefully.
34.460000	37.650000		Claire drew a nice map of the stars.
37.990000	41.870000		Now, Lee needed to do his part of the project.

43.180000	46.290000		"Well, I **suppose**^[To suppose is to guess.] I need to start my model",
46.590000	47.640000		Lee thought.

48.340000	51.880000		Making a model of a planet was really hard.
52.280000	54.930000		Lee tried to read **several**^[Several is more than two but not many.] books,
55.030000	58.170000		but he couldn't **understand**^[To understand something you need to know what it means.] any of the **charts**^[A chart is a list of information.].
58.830000	61.220000		"We're going to **fail**^[To fail means you do not succeed in what you try to do.] because of me!”
61.660000	62.640000		Lee said.
63.280000	66.790000		He put his head down on the table and said,
67.760000	71.000000		"I wish I could see a **planet**^[A planet is a large round thing in space.] and an **alien**^[An alien is a creature from a different world.],
71.060000	73.390000		**instead**^[Instead means in place of.] of having to read about it!”

74.690000	75.680000		**Suddenly**^[If something happens suddenly, it happens quickly and unexpectedly.],
75.880000	79.990000		he had a great idea that would help him **solve**^[To solve something is to find an answer to it.] his problem.
80.880000	84.950000		Why not go on the web and look for **photographs**^[A photograph is a picture made using a camera.] of the Earth
84.960000	87.740000		and other planets taken from space.
88.390000	94.170000		They would give him a really good **view**^[To view is to look at something.] of the planets they had to talk about in their report.
94.780000	96.700000		Instead of a bad grade,
96.800000	99.800000		his group would have the best project **ever**^[Ever means at any time.].
100.580000	103.950000		The photos of Earth showed lots of **clouds**^[A cloud is a group of water drops in the sky.],
104.060000	108.320000		but you could still see the shapes of land and seas on Earth.
109.040000	111.690000		He also looked at photos of Mars.

112.710000	118.150000		Lee now had **plenty of**^[a lot of (mang sắc thái dồi dào, đầy đủ, không thiếu.)] ideas for making a model of the planet Mars.
119.270000	123.750000		All he had to do was to turn his ideas into a model.
124.470000	128.640000		He used a small ball to help him make the **shape**^[An object's shape is the arrangement of its sides and surfaces.] he wanted
128.710000	132.820000		and then painted it to look like the photos of Mars that he had seen.
133.710000	138.213868		Sometimes seeing is much more helpful than just reading!
