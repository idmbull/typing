4.050000	7.020000		John's dog was a **bad dog**^[con chó hư].
7.330000	9.490000		He bit people **frequently**^[thường xuyên (When something happens frequently, it happens often.)].
9.970000	12.190000		John was **concerned**^[lo lắng (worried and feeling concern about something/somebody)] about this.
12.460000	16.260000		It was not an **appropriate**^[phù hợp, thích hợp (When a thing is appropriate, it is right or normal.)] way for a dog to **behave**^[cư xử, hành xử (To behave is to act in a particular way, especially to be good.)].
16.980000	21.340000		His friends in the **village**^[A village is a very small town.] always **expected**^[If you expect something to happen, you believe it will happen.] the dog to bite them.
22.160000	26.010000		The news about John's dog **spread**^[lan truyền (To spread is to move out to cover a larger area.)] through the village.
26.380000	29.880000		**None**^[None means not any of something.] of the people wanted to go to John's house.
30.560000	33.820000		John tried to **instruct**^[To instruct is to teach.] the dog to behave,
33.930000	35.570000		but it never worked.
35.990000	39.920000		He tried to be **patient**^[kiên trì, nhẫn nại (If people are patient, they don't become angry or upset easily.)] and teach the dog to be **calm**^[bình tĩnh(When someone is calm, they do not get excited or upset.)].
40.310000	42.510000		That also didn't work.
43.190000	45.810000		John didn't want to **punish**^[trừng phạt (To punish means to make someone suffer for breaking the rules or laws.)] the dog.
46.510000	49.600000		"How will I stop my dog's bad **habit**^[thói quen (A habit is a thing that you do often.)]?”
50.830000	52.460000		John asked himself.

53.230000	56.630000		John's friend came to talk to him about the **issue**^[vấn đề (An issue is an important topic.)].
57.440000	60.940000		"During their important meeting,” his friend said,
61.230000	64.850000		"the people in the village asked me to **represent**^[đại diện (To represent is to speak or act for a person or group.)] them.
65.270000	68.320000		We want your dog to stop this habit.
68.840000	72.110000		Why don't you put a bell around the dog's neck?
72.490000	76.490000		This way, we would hear your dog coming down the street"

77.650000	80.260000		John thought this was a great idea.
80.570000	83.690000		Now, people could **stay away from**^[tránh xa, không lại gần] the dog.
84.000000	87.530000		It would not be able to bite anyone anymore.

88.240000	90.380000		The dog liked the bell, too.
90.820000	93.580000		People looked at him when they heard his bell.
94.010000	96.670000		This made the dog very **content**^[hài lòng, thỏa mãn (To be content is to be happy and not want more.)].
96.940000	99.910000		He liked the sound the bell made when he walked.

100.860000	106.400000		One day, John's dog **strolled**^[To stroll means to walk slowly and calmly.] through the village and met some other dogs.
106.890000	110.160000		He expected them to want a bell like his.
110.500000	112.440000		But they laughed at his bell.
112.920000	115.890000		They said the bell made people **avoid**^[tránh xa (To avoid something is to stay away from it.)] him.
117.040000	119.120000		John's dog **shook**^[lắc (đầu) (To shake is to move back and forth or up and down quickly.)] his head.
119.600000	123.620000		"No, they look at me because they like the bell."

124.320000	125.940000		The other dogs said,
126.370000	130.520000		"You have the wrong idea about what makes you **popular**^[nổi tiếng].
130.900000	132.890000		Of course, they like your bell.
133.080000	137.010000		It tells them where you are so they can avoid you.
137.270000	140.100000		You aren't able to bite them anymore!"

141.280000	142.250000		You see,
142.430000	147.310000		being popular isn't something **positive**^[tốt, tích cực (If something is positive, it is good.)] when it's for the wrong reason.
