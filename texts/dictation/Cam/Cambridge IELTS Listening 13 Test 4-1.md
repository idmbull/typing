127.080000	128.680000	MARTHA	Hi Alex.
128.620000	133.170000		It’s Martha Clines here. James White gave me your number.
133.080000	135.400000		I hope you don’t mind me calling you.

135.350000	137.870000	ALEX	Of course not. How are you, Martha?

137.900000	139.100000	MARTHA	Good thanks.
139.400000	142.560000		I’m ringing because I need a bit of advice.

142.540000	144.110000	ALEX	Oh yeah. What about?

144.020000	148.138815	MARTHA	The training you did at JPNW a few years ago.
148.073640	150.104923		I’m **applying for**^[nộp đơn, ứng tuyển (dùng khi bạn muốn xin việc, xin học bổng hoặc yêu cầu một điều gì đó chính thức.)] the same thing.

150.115786	153.680000	ALEX	Oh right. Yes, I did **mine**^[my training] in 2014.
153.740000	156.072075		Best thing I ever did. I’m still working there.

156.061213	157.330000	MARTHA	Really?
157.260000	158.733382		What are you doing?

158.733382	161.900000	ALEX	Well, now I work in the **customer services department**^[bộ phận chăm sóc khách hàng]
161.880000	164.490000		but I did my initial training in Finance.
164.480000	168.498749		I stayed there for the first two years and then moved to where I am now.

168.498749	171.280000	MARTHA	That’s the same department I’m applying for.
171.560000	172.963228		Did you enjoy it?

172.941503	177.940000	ALEX	I was pretty nervous to begin with. I didn’t **do well**^[làm tốt / đạt kết quả tốt] in my exams at school
177.850000	180.250000		and I was really worried because I failed Maths.
180.300000	184.170000		But it didn’t actually **matter**^[quan trọng, ý nghĩa] because I did lots of courses on the job.

184.260000	187.800000	MARTHA	Did you get a **diploma**^[Văn bằng/Bằng nghề] at the end of your **trainee period**^[thời gian đào tạo (trainee = người đang được đào tạo)]?
188.010000	190.766828		I’m hoping to do the one in business skills.

190.766828	192.270000	ALEX	Yes. That sounds good.
192.420000	196.420000		I **took**^[take a course = tham gia / theo học một khóa] the one on IT skills but I wish I’d **done**^[had done: hối tiếc về một hành động trong quá khứ] that one instead.

196.390000	198.600000	MARTHA	OK, that’s good to know.
199.000000	203.570000		What about the other trainees? How did you **get on**^[get on (with someone) = hòa hợp, có quan hệ tốt] with them?

203.740000	207.450000	ALEX	There were about 20 of us who started at the same time
207.370000	211.170000		and we were all **around**^[khoảng / xấp xỉ] the same age – I was 18
211.130000	214.710000		and there was only one person younger than me, who was 17.
214.850000	217.600000		**The rest**^[Phần còn lại (Khi có mạo từ "The" đi trước, rest thường mang nghĩa là những người còn lại hoặc những thứ còn lại.)] were between 18 and 20.
217.750000	219.180000		I made some good friends.

219.150000	223.190000	MARTHA	I’ve heard lots of good things about the training at JPNW.
223.450000	226.569554		It seems like there are a lot of **opportunities**^[cơ hội] there.

226.569554	227.940000	ALEX	Yeah, definitely.
228.070000	232.840000		Because of its size you can work in **loads of**^[lots of: dùng trong khẩu ngữ] different **areas**^[lĩnh vực, bộ phận] within the organisation.

232.750000	234.450000	MARTHA	What about pay?
234.570000	238.648628		I know you get **a lower**^[a lower … than … = thấp hơn so với …] **minimum wage**^[lương tối thiểu] than **regular employees**^[nhân viên chính thức].

238.637766	240.566062	ALEX	That’s right – which isn’t great.
240.580000	243.790000		But you get the same number of days’ holiday as everyone else.
243.800000	248.470000		And the pay **goes up**^[increases] **massively**^[rất nhiều (Dùng khi nói về sự thay đổi, tăng trưởng hoặc tác động có quy mô lớn.)] if they offer you a job at the end of the training period.

248.400000	251.400000	MARTHA	Yeah, but I’m not doing it for the money
251.500000	254.740000		– it’s the experience I think will be really useful.
254.880000	259.030000		Everyone says by the end of the year you **gain**^[đạt được, có thêm (tích lũy dần)] so much **confidence**^[sự tự tin].

258.990000	261.980000	ALEX	You’re right. That’s the most useful part about it.
262.300000	266.977969		There’s a lot of **variety**^[sự đa dạng] too. You’re **given**^[được giao / được cho] lots of different things to do.
266.977969	270.130000		I enjoyed it all – I didn’t even mind the studying.

270.110000	272.593870	MARTHA	Do you have to spend any time in college?

272.593870	274.540000	ALEX	Yes, one day each month.
274.650000	278.390000		So you get lots of support from both your **tutor**^[người hướng dẫn học tập] and your manager.

278.340000	279.980000	MARTHA	That’s good.
280.290000	283.340000		And the company is easy to get to, isn’t it?

283.250000	286.117655	ALEX	Yes, it’s very close to the train station
286.117655	288.260000		so the location’s a real advantage.

319.650000	322.148492	ALEX	Have you got a date for your interview yet?

322.159355	325.310000	MARTHA	Yes, it’s on the 23rd of this month.

325.240000	328.557354	ALEX	**So long as**^[as long as: miễn là / với điều kiện là] you’re **well prepared**^[chuẩn bị kỹ / chuẩn bị tốt] there’s nothing to worry about.
328.535629	330.270000		Everyone’s very friendly.

330.300000	333.410000	MARTHA	I am not sure what I should wear.
333.560000	334.940000		What do you think?

334.850000	338.290000	ALEX	Nothing too casual – like jeans, for example.
338.500000	342.630000		If you’ve got a nice jacket, wear that with a **skirt**^[váy] or **trousers**^[quần tây].

342.550000	344.430000	MARTHA	OK. Thanks.
344.580000	346.170000		Any other tips?

346.290000	351.060000	ALEX	Erm, well I know it’s really obvious but arrive **in plenty of time**^[đến sớm, có nhiều thời gian dự phòng].
351.030000	352.850000		They hate people who are late.
352.950000	356.130000		So make sure you know exactly where you have to get to.
356.250000	361.400000		And one other useful **piece of advice**^[một lời khuyên] my manager told me before I had the interview for this job
361.460000	363.050000		– is to smile.
363.110000	365.077003		Even if you feel **terrified**^[cực kỳ sợ hãi].
365.077003	367.195186		It makes people respond better to you.

367.162598	370.616866	MARTHA	I’ll have to **practise**^[practice (n)] doing that in the mirror!

370.627729	372.640000	ALEX	Yeah – well, good luck.
372.790000	374.983582		Let me know if you need any more information.

374.994445	376.480000	MARTHA	Thanks very much.
