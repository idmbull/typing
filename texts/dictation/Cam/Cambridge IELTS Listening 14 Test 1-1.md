91.110000	93.470000	OFFICER	Good morning. What can I do for you?

93.740000	95.690000	LOUISE	I want to report a **theft**^[vụ trộm].
95.660000	98.870000		I had some things **stolen**^[bị lấy trộm] out of my bag yesterday.

98.830000	100.860000	OFFICER	I’m sorry to hear that.
100.980000	104.390000		Right, so I’ll need to take a few details.
104.410000	106.090000		Can I start with your name?

106.060000	107.518485	LOUISE	Louise Taylor.

107.469261	109.030000	OFFICER	OK, thank you.
109.180000	111.480000		And are you resident in the UK?

111.410000	115.740000	LOUISE	No, I’m actually Canadian. Though my mother was British.

115.760000	117.470000	OFFICER	And your date of birth?

117.490000	120.950000	LOUISE	December 14th, 1977.

120.880000	123.395122	OFFICER	So you’re just visiting this country?

123.311498	124.270000	LOUISE	That’s right.
124.350000	126.750648		I **come over**^[sang, ghé qua, đến thăm (thường là đi sang một quốc gia khác] most summers on business.
126.715169	128.600000		I’m an **interior designer**^[nhà thiết kế nội thất]
128.640000	132.764675		and I come over to buy **old furniture**^[đồ nội thất cũ, đồ dùng đã qua sử dụng hoặc phong cách cổ.], **antiques**^[đồ cổ] you know.
132.970000	135.650000		There are some really **lovely**^[đẹp, dễ thương, hấp dẫn] things around here,
135.790000	138.580000		but you need to **get out**^[go out] to the small towns.
138.570000	140.580000		I’ve had a really good trip this year,
140.510000	142.040000		until this happened.

142.110000	142.980000	OFFICER	OK.
143.130000	145.370000		So you’ve been here **quite a while**^[quite a long time]?^[Vậy là bạn đã ở đây khá lâu rồi à?]

145.300000	148.050000	LOUISE	Yes, I’m here for two months.
148.030000	149.735678		I go back next week.

149.656122	152.340000	OFFICER	So may I ask where you’re staying now?

152.610000	158.370000	LOUISE	Well **at present**^[now] I’ve got a place at Park Apartments, that’s on King Street.
158.675864	162.454808		I was staying at the Riverside Apartments on the same street,
162.375251	166.025864		but the apartment there was only available for six weeks
166.040000	168.153057		so I had to find another one.

168.043667	168.910000	OFFICER	OK.
169.020000	170.670000		And the **apartment**^[căn hộ] number?

170.610000	171.790000	LOUISE	Fifteen.

171.750000	172.380000	LOUISE	Right.

224.840000	228.340000	OFFICER	Now, I need to take some details of the theft.
228.670000	232.683496		So you said you had some things stolen out of your bag?

232.603939	233.630000	LOUISE	That’s right.

233.700000	238.143076	OFFICER	And were you actually **carrying**^[mang, xách (túi)] the bag when the theft **took place**^[happen (xảy ra)]?

238.113242	239.020000	LOUISE	Yes,
238.990000	241.370000		I really can’t understand it.
241.460000	243.270000		I **had**^[have + clothing/accessory + on = mang thứ gì đó trên người.] my **backpack**^[ba lô] on.
243.400000	246.870000		And I went into a supermarket to buy a few things
246.860000	250.500000		and when I **opened it up**^[open up: mở ra hoàn toàn] my wallet wasn’t there.

250.540000	253.140000	OFFICER	And what did your wallet have in it?

253.130000	257.620000	LOUISE	Well, **fortunately**^[luckily (may mắn là)] I don’t keep my credit cards in that wallet
257.850000	262.430000		– I keep them with my passport in an **inside compartment**^[ngăn bên trong (thường khó mở hơn, an toàn hơn)] in my backpack.
262.570000	265.280000		But there was quite a bit of cash there …
265.530000	269.550000		about £250 **sterling**^[bảng Anh], I should think.
270.030000	273.870000		I withdrew £300 from my account yesterday,
274.020000	275.880000		but I did a bit of shopping,
275.890000	279.950000		so I **must have**^[suy đoán chắc chắn về quá khứ] **already**^[nhấn mạnh rằng số tiền đã được tiêu trước thời điểm mở ví] spent about £50 of that.

279.910000	280.740000	OFFICER	OK.

281.080000	282.900000	LOUISE	At first I thought, oh
282.910000	285.780000		I must have left the wallet back in the apartment,
286.020000	289.400000		but then I **realised**^[nhận ra] my phone **had gone**^[biến mất (đi luôn)] **as well**^[cũng vậy / cũng thế (trang trọng hơn too)].
289.430000	291.430000		It was only a week old,
291.350000	294.180000		and that’s when I realised I’d been **robbed**^[steal (tập trung vào vật bị lấy);  rob (tập trung vào người bị hại)].
294.800000	298.574759		Anyway at least they didn’t take the **keys to**^[chìa khóa dùng để mở / tiếp cận cái gì] my **rental car**^[xe thuê].

298.490376	299.510000	OFFICER	Yes.
299.490000	302.740000		So you say the theft **occurred**^[happen (thường dùng trong văn viết; pháp lý)] yesterday?

302.680000	303.496217	LOUISE	Yes.

303.503249	306.180000	OFFICER	So that was September the tenth.
306.500000	313.580000		And do you have any idea at all of where or when the things might possibly have been stolen?

313.840000	321.430000	LOUISE	Well at first I couldn’t believe it because the bag had been on my back **ever since**^[kể từ khi] I left the apartment after lunch.
321.710000	323.870000		It’s just a small backpack,
323.870000	328.810000		but I generally use it when I’m travelling because it seems safer than a handbag.
329.210000	331.820000		Anyway, I met up with a friend,
331.960000	335.550000		and we spent **a couple of hours**^[2–3 tiếng (văn nói)] in the museum.
336.000000	338.920000		But I do remember that as we were leaving there,
338.960000	341.050000		at about 4 o’clock,
341.210000	344.000000		a group of young boys ran up to us,
344.020000	346.650000		and they were really **crowding**^[vây sát, chen chúc] round us,
346.710000	349.970000		and they were asking us that time it was,
350.010000	352.770000		then **all of a sudden**^[đột nhiên (idiom)] they ran off.

352.770000	355.410000	OFFICER	Can you remember anything about them?

355.870000	358.600000	LOUISE	The one who did most of the talking
358.580000	363.295379		was wearing a T-shirt with a picture of something …
363.300000	364.510000		let’s see …
365.030000	366.370000		a tiger.

366.380000	369.770000	OFFICER	Right. Any idea of how old he might have been?

370.110000	372.680000	LOUISE	Around twelve years old?

372.910000	376.750000	OFFICER	And can you remember anything else about his **appearance**^[ngoại hình]?

376.840000	380.554704	LOUISE	Not much. He was quite thin …

380.560000	381.650000	OFFICER	Colour of hair?

381.840000	383.340000	LOUISE	I do remember that
383.440000	384.920000		– he was **blond**^[tóc vàng].
385.110000	387.230000		All the others were dark-haired.

387.550000	390.150000	OFFICER	And any details of the others?

390.290000	391.620000	LOUISE	Not really.
391.930000	394.410000		They came and went so quickly.

394.370000	395.210000	OFFICER	Right.
395.620000	403.130000		So what I’m going to do now is give you a **crime**^[tội phạm; hành vi phạm pháp] reference number so you can contact your **insurance company**^[công ty bảo hiểm].
403.320000	405.680000		So this is ten digits:
405.940000	408.890000		87954
409.180000	411.930000		82361.

412.260000	415.772874	LOUISE	Thank you. So should I …
