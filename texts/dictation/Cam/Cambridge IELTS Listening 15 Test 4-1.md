51.440000	52.162812	MAN	Hello.
52.256684	55.730000		**Do you mind if**^[bạn có phiền nếu…? (dùng để xin phép hoặc yêu cầu một cách lịch sự)] I ask you some questions about your journey today?
55.820000	58.420000		We’re doing a customer satisfaction survey.

58.810000	63.050000	SOPHIE	Yes. OK. I’ve got about ten minutes before my train **home**^[trạng từ chỉ điểm đến đứng sau danh từ] leaves.
63.000000	64.340000		I’m on **a day trip**^[chuyến đi trong ngày (đi du lịch, tham quan và về trong ngày)].

64.270000	65.880000	MAN	Great. Thank you.
65.960000	68.870000		So first of all, could you tell me your name?

68.840000	70.790000	SOPHIE	It’s Sophie Bird.

70.890000	71.880000	MAN	Thank you.
72.030000	74.530000		And would you mind telling me what you do?

74.670000	76.100000	SOPHIE	I’m a **journalist**^[nhà báo; reporter (phóng viên) là một loại journalist.].

75.990000	78.350000	MAN	Oh really? That **must be**^[hẳn là (suy đoán có cơ sở về một điều gì đó.)] interesting.

78.280000	79.610000	SOPHIE	Yes. It is.

79.830000	83.470000	MAN	So was the reason for your visit here today work?^[Vậy công việc có phải là lý do bạn đến đây hôm nay không?]

83.610000	85.700000	SOPHIE	Actually, it’s my day off.
85.740000	87.529956		I came here to do some shopping.

87.390564	88.460000	MAN	Oh right.

88.600000	91.220000	SOPHIE	But I **do**^[dùng để nhấn mạnh] sometimes come here for work.

91.280000	92.110000	MAN	OK.
92.350000	96.540000		Now I’d like to ask some questions about your journey today, if that’s OK.

96.440000	97.770000	SOPHIE	Yes. No problem.

97.620000	102.030000	MAN	Right, so can you tell me which station you’re travelling back to?

102.130000	104.245619	SOPHIE	Staunfirth, where I live.

104.620000	107.010000	MAN	Can I just check the spelling?
107.130000	114.255323		S-T-A-U-N-F-I-R-T-H?

114.120000	115.670000	SOPHIE	That’s right.

115.900000	118.530000	MAN	And you travelled from there this morning?

118.550000	119.465944	SOPHIE	Yes.

119.472582	120.820000	MAN	OK, good.
121.130000	124.410000		Next, can I ask what kind of ticket you bought?
124.310000	127.780000		I **assume**^[chắc là (to think or accept that something is true but without having proof of it)] it wasn’t a **season ticket**^[vé dùng tính theo thời hạn (vé tháng, vé năm...)], as you don’t travel every day.

127.870000	132.430000	SOPHIE	That’s right. No, I just got a normal return ticket.
132.660000	136.180000		I don’t have a **railcard**^[loại thẻ giúp hành khách được giảm giá khi mua vé tàu,] so I didn’t get any discount.
136.320000	139.332683		I **keep**^[keep + V-ing: làm gì đó liên tục, lặp lại, hoặc liên tục có xu hướng làm điều đó.] **meaning to**^[dự định làm gì] get one because it’s a lot cheaper.

139.153464	143.220000	MAN	Yes – **you’d have saved 20%**^[If you had had a railcard, you would have saved 20% (câu điền kiện loại 3)] on your ticket today.
143.070000	145.940000		So you paid the full price for your ticket?

145.890000	148.410000	SOPHIE	I paid £23.70.

148.260000	151.340000	MAN	OK. Do you think that’s **good value for money**^[đáng tiền]?

151.190000	155.850000	SOPHIE	Not really. I think it’s too much for a journey that only takes 45 minutes.

155.700000	158.670000	MAN	Yes, that’s one of the main complaints we get.
158.800000	161.620000		So, you didn’t buy your ticket in advance?

161.595644	166.920000	SOPHIE	No. I know it’s cheaper if you buy a week in advance but **I didn’t know I was coming then**^[lúc đó tôi không biết mình sẽ đi].

166.770000	170.450000	MAN	I know. You can’t always **plan ahead**^[lên kế hoạc trước (ahead: phía trước, trước thời điểm hiện tại)]. So,
170.630000	172.490000		did you buy it this morning?

172.540000	174.700000	SOPHIE	No, it was yesterday.

174.660000	178.690000	MAN	Right. And do you usually buy your tickets at the station?

178.920000	184.790000	SOPHIE	Well, I do usually but the ticket office closes early and I hate using ticket machines.
185.120000	188.392178		I think ticket offices should be open **for longer hours**^[trong thời gian dài hơn bình thường].
188.292612	191.700000		There’s always a queue for the machines and they’re often **out of order**^[không hoạt động đúng trật tự bình thường → bị hỏng.].

191.550000	194.470000	MAN	A lot of customers are saying the same thing.

194.470000	196.500000	SOPHIE	So to answer your question …
196.600000	199.490000		I got an e-ticket online.

235.639634	237.850000	MAN	OK. Thank you.
237.790000	241.800000		Now I’d like to ask you about your satisfaction with your journey.
242.180000	245.540000		So what would you say you were most satisfied with today?

245.880000	249.200000	SOPHIE	Well, I like the wifi on the train.
249.300000	253.810000		It’s improved a lot. It makes it easier for me to work if I want to.

253.870000	256.744028	MAN	That’s the first time today anyone’s mentioned that.
256.631382	259.770000		It’s good to get some positive feedback on that.

259.648257	260.968257	MAN	And, um,
260.820000	263.430000		is there anything you weren’t satisfied with?

264.030000	268.570000	SOPHIE	Well, normally, the trains run **on time**^[đúng giờ] and are pretty reliable^[đáng tin cậy]
268.420000	270.830000		but today there was a delay;
271.030000	274.502854		the train was about 15 minutes **behind schedule**^[late (trễ so với lịch)].

274.427756	276.780647	MAN	OK. I’ll put that down.
276.990000	281.260000		Now I’d also like to ask about the facilities at this station.
281.450000	285.182347		You’ve **probably**^[có lẽ, rất có thể (dùng để suy đoán lịch sự)] **noticed**^[nhận thấy] that the whole station’s been upgraded.
285.380000	287.520000		What are you most satisfied with?

288.260000	296.360000	SOPHIE	I think the best thing is that they’ve improved **the amount of information**^[lượng thông tin] about train times etc. that’s given to passengers
296.510000	297.960000		– it’s much **clearer**^[rõ ràng hơn]
298.000000	303.860000		– before there was only one board and I couldn’t always see it **properly**^[rõ ràng, đúng cách] – which was **frustrating**^[khó chịu, bực bội].

303.760000	307.760000	MAN	That’s good. And is there anything you’re not satisfied with?

307.890000	309.130000	SOPHIE	Let’s see …
309.560000	312.740000		I think things have generally improved a lot.
312.710000	317.160000		The trains are much more modern and I like the new café.
317.430000	321.120000		But one thing is that there aren’t enough places to sit down,
321.160000	323.000000		especially on the **platforms**^[sân ga, nơi hành khách đứng để lên/xuống tàu.].

323.010000	324.040000	MAN	OK
324.190000	328.700000		– so I’ll put ‘seating’ down, **shall I**^[tôi làm vậy nhé?], as the thing you’re least satisfied with?

328.560000	329.990000	SOPHIE	Yes, OK.

330.610000	334.427462	MAN	Can I ask your **opinion**^[ý kiến] about some of the other **facilities**^[các cơ sở vật chất, tiện nghi (ở ga: nhà vệ sinh, ghế ngồi, bảng thông tin, cửa hàng…)]?
334.418075	337.540000		We’d like feedback on **whether**^[liệu (Dùng khi có hai khả năng)] people are satisfied,
337.590940	341.580000		dissatisfied or **neither satisfied nor dissatisfied**^[neither A nor B: không A mà cũng không B].

341.450000	342.460000	SOPHIE	OK.

342.850000	345.590000	MAN	What about the parking at the station?

346.200000	350.470000	SOPHIE	Well **to be honest**^[thật lòng mà nói, nói thật thì], I don’t really have an opinion as I never use it.

350.630000	354.180000	MAN	So, neither satisfied nor dissatisfied for that then.

354.230000	356.240000	SOPHIE	Yes, I **suppose so**^[cho là vậy] …

356.110000	358.400000	MAN	OK, and what about …?
