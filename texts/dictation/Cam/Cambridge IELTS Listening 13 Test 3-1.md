118.040000	120.340000	LINDA	Hello, Linda speaking.

120.740117	122.491646	MATT	Oh hi, Linda.
122.391976	126.510117		This is Matt Brooks. Alex White gave me your number.
126.940000	130.740000		He said you’d be able to give me some **advice**^[lời khuyên] about moving to Banford.

130.830000	132.070000	LINDA	Yes,
132.160000	134.220000		Alex did mention you.
134.370000	135.780000		How can I help?

136.080000	140.260000	MATT	Well, first of all – which area to live in?

140.660000	143.570000	LINDA	Well, I live in Dalton,
143.750000	146.370000		which is a really nice suburb
146.670000	149.560000		– not too expensive, and
149.650000	151.480000		there’s a nice park.

151.880000	153.566466	MATT	Sounds good.
153.591384	157.390000		Do you know how much it would be to rent a two bedroom flat there?

157.760000	162.420000	LINDA	Yeah, you should be able to get something **reasonable**^[khá ổn, hợp lý (Khi bổ nghĩa cho đại từ bất định (something / someone / anything…), tính từ luôn đứng sau)] for
162.620000	165.700000		850 pounds per month.
165.930000	168.990000		That’s what people typically pay.
169.390000	174.320000		You certainly wouldn’t want to pay more than 900 pounds.
174.520000	177.660000		That doesn’t include bills or anything.

177.990000	179.810000	MATT	No. That sounds alright.
180.130000	182.420000		I’ll definitely **have a look**^[xem / xem thử / nhìn qua / tìm hiểu (look at / check, nhưng nhẹ nhàng và lịch sự hơn.)] there.
182.800000	186.405663		Are the transport links easy from where you live?

186.405663	188.830000	LINDA	Well, I’m very lucky.
189.230000	191.680000		I work in the city centre
191.740000	195.010000		so I don’t have to use public transport.
195.250000	197.300000		I go by bike.

197.460000	199.750000	MATT	Oh, I wish I could do that.
199.810000	202.525499		Is it safe to cycle around the city?

202.481051	204.760000	LINDA	Yes, it’s fine.
205.090000	207.260000		And it keeps me **fit**^[khỏe mạnh, dẻo dai, có thể lực tốt].
207.920000	214.340000		Anyway, driving to work in the city centre would be a **nightmare**^[cơn ác mộng]
214.410000	217.430000		because there’s **hardly any**^[almost no (gần như không có)] parking.
217.960000	222.280000		And the traffic during the **rush hour**^[giờ cao điểm] can be bad.

222.380000	224.250000	MATT	I’d be working from home
224.390000	228.120000		but I’d have to go to London one or two days a week.

228.240000	230.700000	LINDA	Oh, that’s perfect.
231.030000	234.400000		Getting to London is no problem.
234.820000	241.830000		There’s a fast train every 30 minutes which only takes 45 minutes.

242.050000	243.040000	MATT	That’s good.

243.260000	244.100000	LINDA	Yeah,
244.410000	248.450000		the train service isn’t bad during the week.
248.870000	251.460000		And they run quite late at night.
251.880000	255.630000		It’s weekends that are a problem.
256.240000	259.490000		They’re always doing **engineering work**^[thường ám chỉ sửa đường, sửa đường sắt, bảo trì hạ tầng]
259.610000	262.510000		and you have to take a bus to Hadham
262.650000	267.180000		and **pick up**^[bắt tàu, bắt xe] the train there, **which**^[nói về cách di chuyển, không phải cái tàu] is really slow.
267.880000	270.210000		But **other than that**^[ngoài điều đó],
270.270000	273.310000		Banford’s a great place to live.
273.510000	275.450000		I’ve never been happier.

316.760000	321.000000	LINDA	There are some nice restaurants in the city centre
321.090000	323.300000		and a **brand new**^[mới toanh] cinema
323.470000	326.700000		which has only been open a couple of months.
327.170000	329.856338		There’s a good arts centre too.

329.781585	331.999242	MATT	Sounds like Banford’s got it all.

331.999242	334.790000	LINDA	Yes! We’re really lucky.
334.950000	339.210000		There are lots of really good aspects to living here.
339.620000	346.300000		The schools are good and the hospital here is one of the best in the country.
346.910000	352.390000		Everyone I know who’s been there’s had a positive experience.
352.710000	361.290000		Oh, I can give you the name of my dentist too in Bridge Street, if you’re interested.
361.910000	367.540000		I’ve **been going**^[Nhấn mạnh hành động lặp đi lặp lại trong thời gian dài] to him **for years**^[suốt nhiều năm] and I’ve never had any problems.

367.610000	370.070000	MATT	Oh, OK. Thanks!

370.210000	373.890000	LINDA	I’ll find his number and send it to you.

374.250000	377.120000	MATT	Thanks, that would be really helpful.

377.650000	380.900000	LINDA	Are you planning to visit Banford soon?

381.190000	384.870000	MATT	Yes. My wife and I are both coming next week.
385.350000	388.540000		We want to **make some appointments**^[đặt lịch hẹn] with **estate agents**^[môi giới bất động sản (Anh–Anh)].

388.670000	392.540000	LINDA	I could meet you if you like and show you around.

392.990000	394.050000	MATT	Are you sure?
394.380000	396.370000		We’d really **appreciate**^[cảm kích, biết ơn] that.

396.820000	403.560000	LINDA	**Either**^[Either … or … Dùng khi chọn 1 trong 2 khả năng] a Tuesday or Thursday is good for me, after 5.30.

404.090000	406.020000	MATT	Thursday’s **preferable**^[thích hợp hơn (prefer: thích cái gì đó hơn)]
406.290000	409.980000		– Tuesday I need to get home before 6 pm.

410.280000	411.440000	LINDA	Okay
411.870000	412.900000		great.
413.580000	416.780000		Let me know which train you're catching
416.880000	420.990000		and I’ll meet you in the cafe **outside**^[bên ngoài (nhà ga)].
421.330000	422.920000		You can’t miss it.
423.120000	427.720000		It’s **opposite**^[đối diện] the station and next to the museum.

428.080000	428.980000	MATT	Brilliant.
429.390000	432.290000		I’ll text you next week then.
432.650000	435.482903		Thanks so much for all the advice.

435.433068	436.960000	LINDA	No problem.
437.310000	439.170000		I’ll see you next week.
