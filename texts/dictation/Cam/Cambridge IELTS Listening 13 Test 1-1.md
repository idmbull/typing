115.630000	119.930000	OFFICIAL	Hello, Tourist Information Centre, Mike speaking, how can I help you?

120.200000	121.370000	WOMAN	Oh, hi.
121.460000	124.340000		I wanted to **find out**^[tìm hiểu (​to get some information about something/somebody by asking, reading, etc.)] about cookery classes.
124.410000	127.600000		I believe there are some one-day classes for tourists?

127.660000	131.380000	OFFICIAL	Well, they’re open to everyone, but tourists are always welcome.
131.810000	134.610000		OK, let me give you some details of what’s available.
134.940000	136.660000		There are several classes.
136.660000	139.690000		One very popular one is at the Food Studio.

139.830000	140.882598	WOMAN	OK.

140.849416	143.130000	OFFICIAL	They focus on **seasonal**^[theo mùa] **products**^[Sản phẩm (ở đây thường hiểu là nông sản, thực phẩm)],
143.010000	147.060000		and as well as teaching you how to cook them, they also show you how to choose them.

147.280000	149.120000	WOMAN	Right, that sounds good.
149.140000	150.940000		How big are the classes?

151.020000	153.970000	OFFICIAL	I’m not sure exactly, but they’ll be quite small.

154.170000	156.680000	WOMAN	And could I **get**^[get a lesson = tham gia / đăng ký một buổi học] a **private lesson**^[Một buổi học riêng (thường là 1 thầy 1 trò); group class] there?

156.680000	157.740000	OFFICIAL	**I think so**^[Tôi nghĩ là có (chưa chắc chắn 100%)] …
157.820000	159.130000		let me check,
159.450000	161.960000		yes, they do offer those.
162.120000	167.270000		Though in fact most of the people who attend the classes find it’s a nice way of **getting to know**^[làm quen, hiểu nhau dần] **one another**^[lẫn nhau (nhiều người) (each other - 2 người)].

167.250000	169.310000	WOMAN	I suppose it must be, yes.

169.210000	172.060000	OFFICIAL	And this company has a special deal for clients
172.020000	174.470000		where they offer a discount of 20 percent
174.420000	176.410000		if you return for a **further class**^[lớp học tiếp theo (another class)].

176.440000	179.740000	WOMAN	OK. But you said there were several classes?

179.610000	180.910000	OFFICIAL	That’s right.
181.060000	184.411832		Another one you might be interested in is Bond’s Cookery School.
184.362060	185.540000		They’re quite new,
185.510000	188.900000		they just opened six months ago, but I’ve heard good things about them.
189.130000	192.640000		They **concentrate on**^[focus on; tập trung vào] teaching you to **prepare**^[chế biến; bao gồm cả sơ chế và nấu (gần nghĩa với cook] healthy food,
192.800000	195.660000		and they have quite a lot of specialist staff.

195.990000	199.820000	WOMAN	So is that food for people **on a diet**^[be on a diet: ăn kiêng] and things like that?
200.140000	202.350000		I don’t know if I’d be interested in that.

202.600000	207.660000	OFFICIAL	Well, I don’t think they particularly focus on low calorie **diets**^[chế độ ăn uống] or **weight loss**^[giảm cân].
207.880000	211.510000		It’s **more to do with**^[chủ yếu liên quan đến / thiên về] **recipes**^[công thức nấu ăn] that **look at**^[xem xét, chú trọng đến] **specific needs**^[nhu cầu cụ thể (về sức khỏe, dinh dưỡng…)],
211.550000	215.490000		like including **ingredients**^[nguyên liệu (nấu ăn)] that will help build up your **bones**^[xương]
215.360000	217.440000		and make them stronger, that sort of thing.

217.700000	218.580000	WOMAN	I see.
218.780000	222.150000		Well, I might be interested, I’m not sure.
222.370000	224.530000		Do they have a website I could check?

224.700000	227.510000	OFFICIAL	Yes, just **key in**^[gõ (bàn phím)] the name of the school
227.390000	228.390000		– it’ll **come up**^[hiện ra / xuất hiện (trên màn hình)].
228.620000	233.439585		And if you want to know more about them, every Thursday evening they have a **lecture**^[bài giảng / buổi thuyết trình (thường mang tính học thuật)] at the school.
233.439585	234.290000		It’s free
234.220000	237.680000		and you don’t need to book or anything, just **turn up**^[đến, xuất hiện] at 7.30.
237.940000	241.640000		And that might give you an idea of **whether**^[liệu] you want to go to an actual class.

278.230000	281.150000	OFFICIAL	OK, there’s one more place you might be interested in.
281.620000	283.980000		That’s got a **rather**^[khá là] strange name,
283.860000	287.010000		it’s called The Arretsa Centre
287.380000	292.410000		– that’s spelled A-R-R-E-T-S-A.

292.530000	293.506251	WOMAN	OK.

293.489660	295.650000	OFFICIAL	They’ve got a very good **reputation**^[danh tiếng, uy tín].
295.980000	301.820000		They do a bit of meat and fish cookery but they mostly specialise in **vegetarian dishes**^[các món chay].

301.900000	306.320000	WOMAN	Right. That’s certainly an area I’d like to learn more about.
306.450000	309.050000		I’ve got lots of friends who don’t eat meat.
309.140000	312.470000		In fact, I think I might have seen that school today.
312.570000	314.460000		Is it just by the market?

314.320000	315.520000	OFFICIAL	That’s right.
315.670000	319.580000		So they don’t have any problem **getting**^[lấy / mua / kiếm được] their ingredients. They’re right next door.
320.020000	324.613832		And they also offer a special two-hour course in how to use a knife.
324.840000	329.860000		They cover all the different skills – buying them, **sharpening**^[mài (dao)], **chopping**^[cắt / chặt / thái] techniques.
330.110000	333.790000		It gets **booked up**^[được đặt kín / hết chỗ] quickly though so you’d need to check it was available.

333.930000	336.370000	WOMAN	Right, well thank you very much.
336.250000	337.370000		I’ll go and …
