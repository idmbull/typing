99.530000	102.120000	ANDREW	Good morning, Clare **House Hotel**^[khách sạn dạng nhà (giống homestay hoặc boutique hotel nhỏ)].
102.090000	103.530000		Andrew speaking.
103.460000	105.130000		I’m the Events Manager.

105.170000	107.030000	SAM	Good morning, Andrew.
106.990000	108.730000		My name’s Samantha.
109.020000	113.990000		I’m **arranging**^[to plan or organize something in advance] a party for my parents’ fiftieth **wedding anniversary**^[kỷ niệm ngày cưới],
113.990000	118.590000		and I’m ringing to ask about **hiring**^[thuê ngắn hạn (rent thuê dài hạn hơi)] a room some time next September.
119.050000	124.050000		**Also**^[ngoài ra (bổ sung thông tin)] my parents and several of the guests will need accommodation.

124.060000	125.280000	ANDREW	OK,
125.190000	127.180000		I’m sure we can help you with that.
127.570000	131.060000		Will you be having a sit-down meal or a buffet?

131.160000	133.490000	SAM	Probably a sit-down.

133.430000	136.390000	ANDREW	And do you know how many people there’ll be?

136.370000	138.780000	SAM	Around eighty, I think.

138.780000	142.250000	ANDREW	Well we have two rooms that can hold that number.
142.530000	144.610000		One is the Adelphi Room.
144.620000	147.220000		That can seat eighty-five,
147.360000	149.510000		or hold over a hundred
149.470000	151.880000		if people are standing for a buffet.

151.840000	152.930000	SAM	Right.

153.020000	155.040000	ANDREW	If you have live music,
155.240000	159.100000		there’s room for four or five musicians in the **gallery**^[tầng lửng / gác / khu vực trên cao trong hội trường]
159.060000	160.640000		**overlooking**^[nhìn xuống / nhìn ra] the room.
161.180000	166.350000		Our guests usually **appreciate**^[đánh giá cao] the fact that the music can be loud enough for dancing,
166.460000	169.220000		but not too loud for conversation.

169.100000	172.925032	SAM	Yes, I really don’t like it when you can’t talk.

172.952678	174.100000	ANDREW	Exactly.
174.470000	178.730000		Now the Adelphi Room is at the back of the hotel,
178.840000	180.660000		and there are **French windows**^[cửa kính lớn mở ra ngoài thường mở ra ban công, sân thượng, hoặc vườn]
180.600000	182.830000		leading out onto the **terrace**^[sân thượng / sân ngoài trời liền với tòa nhà].
183.120000	185.830000		This has a beautiful **display**^[sự trưng bày, khung cảnh được sắp xếp đẹp]
185.710000	188.950000		of **pots of roses**^[những chậu hoa hồng] at that time of the year.

189.170000	191.530000	SAM	Which direction does it face?

191.530000	192.850000	ANDREW	Southwest,
192.940000	198.450000		so that side of the hotel **gets the sun**^[được nắng chiếu vào] in the afternoon and early evening.

198.360000	199.780000	SAM	Very nice.

199.940000	201.290000	ANDREW	From the terrace
201.290000	205.660000		you can see the area of trees **within**^[bên trong] the **grounds**^[khuôn viên (xung quanh tòa nhà)] of the hotel,
205.880000	208.680000		or you can **stroll**^[đi dạo thong thả (nhẹ nhàng hơn walk)] through there to the river –
208.810000	213.374222		that’s on the **far side**^[phía xa / phía bên kia (so với vị trí đang đứng)], so it isn’t **visible**^[nhìn thấy được] from the hotel.

213.390000	214.610000	SAM	OK.

214.640000	218.198503	ANDREW	Then another option is the Carlton Room.
218.440000	220.170000		This is a bit bigger –
220.190000	223.030000		it can hold up to a hundred and ten people –
223.110000	226.130000		and it has **the advantage**^[điểm thuận lợi, lợi thế] of a **stage**^[sân khấu],
226.180000	229.320000		which is useful if you have any **entertainment**^[hoạt động giải trí (âm nhạc, biểu diễn…)],
229.390000	232.490000		or **indeed**^[thậm chí] a small band can fit onto it.

232.380000	236.280000	SAM	And can you go outside from the room?

236.160000	237.170000	ANDREW	No,
237.220000	240.430000		the Carlton Room is on the first floor,
240.600000	244.250000		but on one side the windows look out onto the lake.

244.300000	245.540000	SAM	Lovely.
245.630000	248.800000		I think **either of**^[một trong hai (không quan trọng là cái nào) dùng khi chỉ có 2 đối tượng] those rooms would be suitable.

248.820000	252.620000	ANDREW	Can I tell you about some of the options we offer in addition?

252.570000	253.766131	SAM	Please do.

253.649893	256.927816	ANDREW	As well as a meal, you can have an MC,
256.910000	258.740000		a **Master of Ceremonies**^[người dẫn chương trình],
258.700000	261.210000		who’ll be with you throughout the party.

261.360000	264.940000	SAM	What exactly is the MC’s function?
265.060000	269.540000		I suppose they **make a speech**^[phát biểu / đọc diễn văn trước nhiều người] during the meal if we need one, do they?

269.590000	270.940000	ANDREW	That’s right.
271.260000	274.490000		All our MCs are trained as public speakers,
274.550000	277.060000		so they can easily **get people’s attention**^[thu hút sự chú ý của mọi người]
277.480000	282.090000		– many guests **are glad to**^[vui / hài lòng khi làm gì đó] have someone who can **make themselves heard**^[khiến người khác nghe thấy mình] above the **chatter**^[tiếng nói chuyện ồn ào, rì rầm]!
282.310000	284.950000		And they’re also your support
285.110000	286.820000		– if anything goes wrong,
286.900000	289.090000		the MC will deal with it,
288.950000	290.782020		so you can relax.

290.782020	292.060781	SAM	Great!
292.120000	294.980000		I’ll need to ask you about food,
294.870000	298.350000		but something else that’s important is accommodation.
298.620000	301.760000		You obviously have rooms in the hotel,
301.780000	304.680000		but do you also have any other accommodation,
304.700000	306.842803		like **cabins**^[nhà gỗ / phòng nghỉ nhỏ (thường ở khu nghỉ dưỡng)], for example?

306.785267	310.130000	ANDREW	Yes, there are five in the **grounds**^[khuôn viên (xung quanh khách sạn/khu nghỉ)],
310.080000	311.800000		all **self-contained**^[khép kín, đầy đủ tiện nghi].
312.090000	314.780000		They each **sleep**^[có chỗ ngủ cho] two to four people
314.710000	318.660000		and have their own living room, bathroom and small kitchen.

318.740000	321.220000	SAM	That sounds perfect for what we’ll need.

353.170000	356.470000	SAM	Now you have various facilities, don’t you?
356.560000	360.080000		Are they all included in the price of hiring the room?
359.960000	361.908663		The pool, for instance.

361.889114	368.720000	ANDREW	Normally you’d be able to use it, but it’ll be closed throughout **September**^[tháng 9] for **refurbishment**^[sửa chữa, nâng cấp (quy mô lớn)], I’m afraid.
369.122205	372.953788		The gym will be available, though, at no extra charge.
373.110000	377.080000		That’s open all day, from six in the morning until midnight.

377.020000	377.947893	SAM	Right.

377.908795	379.590000	ANDREW	And the **tennis courts**^[sân quần vợt],
379.700000	382.720000		but there is a small additional payment for those.
382.990000	386.940000		We have four courts, and it’s worth booking in advance
386.840000	388.360000		if you possibly can,
388.460000	391.260000		as there can be quite a long waiting list for them!

391.310000	394.860000	SAM	Right. Now could we **discuss**^[thảo luận] the food?
394.760000	398.150000		This would be dinner, around seven o’clock …
