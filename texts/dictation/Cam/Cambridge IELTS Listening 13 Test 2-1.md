102.980000	105.880000	JIM	Hello, South City Cycling Club.

105.930000	107.452044	WOMAN	Oh, hi.
108.110000	111.000000		I want to find out about joining the club.

111.090000	113.210000	JIM	Right. I can help you there.
113.370000	117.300000		I’m the club **secretary**^[thư ký] and my name’s Jim Hunter.

117.250000	118.560000	WOMAN	Oh, hi Jim.

118.600000	122.300000	JIM	So, are you interested in membership for yourself?

122.190000	123.470000	WOMAN	That’s right.

123.500000	128.460000	JIM	OK. Well there are basically two types of adult membership.
128.720000	133.470000		If you’re pretty serious about cycling, there’s the Full membership.
133.650000	136.640000		That costs 260 dollars
136.690000	140.690000		and that covers you not just for **ordinary**^[Normal, thông thường] **cycling**^[ordinary cycling = đạp xe bình thường (không thi đấu)]
140.780000	147.010000		but also for races both here in the city and also in other parts of Australia.

146.860000	150.440000	WOMAN	Right. Well, I’m not really **up to that standard**^[đạt đến trình độ đó].
150.290000	155.420000		I was **more interested in**^[quan tâm hơn đến...] just joining a group to do some cycling in my free time.

155.270000	156.370000	JIM	Sure.
156.380000	158.460000		That’s why most people join.
158.510000	163.610000		So, in that case you’d be better with the **Recreational**^[mang tính chất giải trí, tiêu khiển] membership.
163.840000	168.050000		That’s 108 dollars if you’re over 19,
168.060000	170.980000		and 95 dollars if you’re under.

171.070000	172.630000	WOMAN	I’m 25.

172.590000	173.600000	JIM	OK.
173.810000	175.670000		It’s **paid quarterly**^[thanh toán theo quý; Daily → Weekly → Monthly → Quarterly → Annually / Yearly],
175.560000	180.200000		and you can upgrade it later to the Full membership if you want to, of course.
180.500000	185.680000		Now both types of membership include the club fee of 20 dollars.
185.830000	190.340000		They also provide **insurance**^[bảo hiểm] in case you have an accident,
190.250000	193.370000		though we hope you won’t need that, of course.

193.520000	194.850000	WOMAN	No.
194.700000	198.830000		OK, well, I’ll go with the Recreational membership, I think.
198.840000	202.530000		And that allows me to join in the club activities, and so on?

202.380000	203.530000	JIM	That’s right.
203.440000	209.900000		And once you’re a member of the club, you’re also **permitted**^[cho phép (lịch sự hơn allow)] to wear our kit when you’re **out**^[trạng từ, bổ nghĩa cho động từ cycling] cycling.
209.950000	211.680000		It’s green and white.

211.530000	214.360000	WOMAN	Yes, I’ve seen cyclists wearing it.
214.480000	216.640000		So, can I buy that at the club?

216.850000	221.010000	JIM	No, it’s **made to order**^[custom-made; làm theo yêu cầu, đặt riêng] by a company in Brisbane.
221.210000	223.380000		You can find them online:
223.230000	225.080000		they’re called Jerriz.
225.310000	230.583567		That’s J-E-R-R-I-Z.
230.970000	235.020000		You can use your membership number to **put in an order**^[trong trọng hơn order] on their website.

235.090000	236.150000	WOMAN	OK.
236.460000	239.550000		Now, can you tell me a bit about the **rides**^[chuyến đi (đặc biệt là đi xe đạp / xe máy / cưỡi ngựa)] I can do?

239.670000	240.633722	JIM	Sure.
240.722340	248.195819		So we have training rides **pretty well**^[hầu như; pretty near; almost] every morning, and they’re a really good way of improving your cycling skills
248.181049	251.480000		as well as your **general level of fitness**^[mức độ thể lực tổng quát],
251.330000	253.800000		but they’re different levels.
253.740000	260.440000		Level A is pretty fast – you’re **looking at**^[rơi vào khoảng; nói ước lượng (số lượng, giá cả, thời gian, tốc độ…)] about 30 or 35 kilometres an hour.
260.730000	267.180000		If you can do about 25 kilometres an hour, you’d probably be level B,
267.680000	273.550000		and then level C are the **novices**^[trang trong hơn Beginner], who stay at about 15 kilometres per hour.

273.460000	277.550000	WOMAN	Right. Well I **reckon**^[think; suppose (văn nói (informal), đặc biệt phổ biến ở Anh (UK), Úc và một số vùng miền Nam nước Mỹ.)] I’d be level B.
277.460000	279.770000		So, when are the **sessions**^[buổi tập] for that level?

279.950000	282.760000	JIM	There are **a couple**^[hai hoặc một vài] each week.
282.690000	285.290000		They’re **both**^[both + danh từ số nhiều: cả hai] early morning sessions.
285.300000	290.910000		There’s one on Tuesdays, and for that one you meet at 5.30 am,
290.940000	293.760000		and the meeting point’s the stadium –
293.890000	295.390000		do you know where that is?

295.380000	297.930000	WOMAN	Yes, it’s quite near my home, in fact.
298.260000	300.620000		OK, and how about the other one?

300.750000	302.710000	JIM	That’s on Thursdays.
302.600000	307.720000		It starts at the same time, but they meet at the main gate to the park.

307.860000	310.730000	WOMAN	Is that the one just **past**^[giới từ chỉ vị trí Đi ngang qua một địa điểm nào đó] the shopping mall?

310.950000	311.960000	JIM	That’s it.

348.570000	350.800000	WOMAN	So how long are the rides?

350.880000	353.901769	JIM	They’re about an hour and a half.
353.852090	358.542420		So, if you have a job it’s easy to **fit in**^[tranh thủ (Dùng khi bạn rất bận nhưng cố gắng tìm một khoảng trống trong lịch trình để gặp ai đó hoặc làm việc gì đó.)] before you go to work.
358.800000	365.250000		And the members often go somewhere for coffee afterwards, so it’s quite a social event.

365.250000	367.250000	WOMAN	OK. That sounds good.
367.500000	371.930000		I’ve only just moved to the city so I don’t actually know many people yet.

371.830000	374.350000	JIM	Well, it’s a great way to meet people.

374.460000	376.970000	WOMAN	And does each ride have a leader?

377.090000	379.540000	JIM	Sometimes, but not always.
379.760000	385.590000		But you don’t really need one; the group members on the ride support one another, anyway.

385.700000	387.590000	WOMAN	How would we know where to go?

388.120000	394.030000	JIM	If you check the club website, you’ll see that the route for each ride is clearly marked.
394.180000	398.060000		So you can just print that out and take it along with you.
398.200000	404.227403		It’s **similar**^[tương tự] from one week to another, but it’s not always exactly the same.

404.220000	405.950000	WOMAN	And what do I need to bring?

406.140000	410.020000	JIM	Well, bring a **bottle of water**^[chai nước], and your phone.
410.070000	413.950000		You shouldn’t use if while you’re cycling, but have it with you.

413.920000	414.995374	WOMAN	Right.

414.933275	419.350000	JIM	And in winter, it’s **well**^[đáng kể (dùng để nhấn mạnh mức độ)] before **sunrise**^[bình minh] when we **set out**^[xuất phát],
419.220000	422.740000		so you need to make sure your bike’s got lights.

422.690000	423.890000	WOMAN	That’s OK.
424.320000	425.680000		Well, thanks Jim.
425.540000	427.550000		I’d definitely like to join.
427.690000	430.090000		So what’s the best way of **going about**^[(phrasal verb): tiến hành / thực hiện] it?

430.030000	430.970000	JIM	You can …
